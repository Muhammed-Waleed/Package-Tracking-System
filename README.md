# Package-Tracking-System

Air freight and cargo have seen a rise in popularity in modern times due to being much faster than usual shipping methods such as through sea transits. However, the weather and shipping conditions that the goods face are now different and require different regulations and monitoring to ensure the safety of the goods. Two of the most important factors to be monitored are vibration and temperature. Vibrations can affect hard shipment and breakable shipments immensely. The same goes for temperature which can cause ruin to many kinds of shipments, especially medical shipments. In this project, we will monitor these conditions to ensure the shipments are safely shipped.

The purpose of this project is to make sure that shipped items are kept intact and in good condition and to warn specified personnel if such conditions are not met. The project will be simple, easy to implement and use, and will work for the whole duration a shipment is being transported
